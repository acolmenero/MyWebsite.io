		<strong>Student Teacher</strong> <br/>
		I am currently instructing and assisting two undergraduate computer science classes: CS61B Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as CS198-087 Introduction to Mathematical Thinking. I am currently an Academic Intern (AI) for CS61B starting this semester. For Introduction to Mathematical Thinking I am a Teaching Assistant, Introduction to Mathematical Thinking teaches students discrete mathematics and probability theory. In the past I have also been an AI for CS61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
